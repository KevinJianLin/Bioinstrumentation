Introduction:

Water quality is very crital to human health as well industrial processing. One of devices that can be used to determine water quality is turbidity meter. 

Traditional signal converter has five components. It includes sensing element, signal conditioning, filter, analog to digital converter, microcontroller. In this project, direct digital readable sensors or quasi-digital sensor will be used. The output of this sensor is
microcontroller without using analog to digital converter. [1] In this paper, a turbidity meter prototype will be built. To achieve that, literatures will be reviewed and analyzed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Turbidity is used to measare Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
