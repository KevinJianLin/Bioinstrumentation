**Problem 1**

**Definitions of below items:**

**Measurand:**    
While measuring the quantity of an object, the quantity is used to symbolize the value. 
The object is referred to measurand. A particular object ,it's physically value is being measured by transducer and 
be quantified. This process is called measurant. It includes desired input and object of measurement. 


**Direct operational mode:**   
It can directly communicate through terminal.


**Invasive and non-invasive:**  
Non-Invasive sensors is device that do not require biofluids by take samples from human body. Optical transducer is one of them. 
In opposite, invasive sensor require input of sample. Non-invasive is getting popular in detecting of blood sugar since it does not 
require blood sample. 


**Generating mode:**  
In this mode, induction motor runs faster than synchronous speed of the motor. It occurs when the rotor is connected to a primer mover. 
The motor works as an induction generator. 

Breaking mode refers to actual speed of motor is more than synchronous speed of the motor

	

**Real-time measurements:**   
It's the value of intentianlly measured object at time of measurement. 


**Interfering input:**   
It's a built-in unsensitive parameter that is unintentionally as instrument needs. 


**Correlation coefficient:**   
It's a value that represents how two variables are related to each other. For instance, one variable(x1) has
value of a set of value ( 1, 2 ,3 4) and the other variable has value of (2,4,6,8). It can be concluded that these two variables are 
highly correlated as variable 2 just muliplication of variable 2. 

**Zero drift:**   
microvolt offset and nanovolt offset of instrument which will increase accuracy. It refers to small change of measurand. 


**problem 2:**      
refer to attached A1_answer.m

**problem 3:**  
I have shown my calucation and simulation below. The plot does not look like band pass filter response and I don't know here I did wrong.

```{r}
source_voltage = 2

f_L = 100

f_H = 600

R_1 = 1000

R_2 = 3162

gain_ratio_dB = 10

C_1 = (1/(f_H * 2 * 3.14 *R_1))*1000000
 
C_2 =  (1/(f_L * 2 * 3.14 *R_2))*1000000

gain_ratio_normal = 10^(gain_ratio_dB/20)

sprintf("First resistor R1 is %.2f ohm",R_1)
sprintf("second resistor R2 is %.2f ohm",R_2)
sprintf("First capacitance C1 is %.2f uF",C_1)
sprintf("Second capacitance C2 is %.2f uF",C_2)
sprintf("output voltage divided by input voltage is %.3f",gain_ratio_normal)
  
```
