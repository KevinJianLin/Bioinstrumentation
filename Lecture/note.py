Sensor collects physical signal. Transduce transfer to machine.

after machine gets data from transduce, it has analog step which converts
to human readable data.

instrument span means maximum of calibration point minus minimum point of
calibration. 

ADC

Analog-to-Digital

To determine what maximum of instrucment can undergo, 
resolution matters, if they are same resolution. we look forward repeatablility


first order instrument means the measurement is not as fast as it supposed to be.


60.2% is called tao when they reach steady state;

5 Tao is stead state. It basically means how fast it can read the steay state


Tao is the time to reach from 60% of final destination.



dynamic of instrument refers to outout of vaiable depends on the input
if it does not change, that means it is static.



Jan 15th, 

A   : current unit Ampere
V   : Voltage
W   : Power, watts, 
J   : Jouels



proton does not move,only electron moves. 
electron flows a to b then current flow from point b to a
electron flows direction is opposite of current



charge is -infinite means from long time ago at moment i intereste


voltage, push electron from one point to another unit is Jouels/co

power is how much energy consume over time

Ampere/hour as you see in battery unit.


current is entered in positve side, 

for example, battery enter negative side, means they provide energy



black electrodie is reference point,
red electrode, voltage just meausre the voltage potential;

voltage multiply current is power, I * V =  , the minus power means supply power

number of component is number of branches

Kirchhoff Current Law(KCL) : 

the sum of current at node is 0. In this case, we can apply into multiple equation

we can run

indepedent source: indepent voltage or indepenent current; 

amplifier: 


or dependent source voltage and current. pass through amplifer and gets largers


circular shape indepent;

square shape is dependent ; 



the node is defined component ....

nodes is the net without component;KCL @ b:I1 - 12 + 4 = 0, then we can find I1, this
refers to lecture 2 Exercises b

KCL @ c : -4 + 12 -I2-3 = 0;


Loop: come back to same point.It does not have to be a physical loop but belong
to same circuit. the summation of that path is 0.


if we loss or positve depends on how you entered the system

if the component is Resistenace which is always absor energy, means the loop enter
postive and leave negative and we write positve for voltage,

Voltage source if entering postive side, that means positve , we wrote postive sign


Vbe means b is postive and e is negative,
KVL @ L1(not physical):
    -15-Vbe -5 + VR2 = 0;

nodes is a the loop without component

branch is the one with component

Vae means put red electrode on the a and black electrode on the e;

loop just basically (KVL examples),


Vec + 4 + 6 = 0; then we can find Vec;

slide 39, needs to work on KCL and KVL to find;

omega t is radio frequency;

all of signale to compare , we need same frequencies.


AC circuit and DC circuit :

Trigonometric Identities: use the chart as example;

total phase,

retangular representation ,  wl90,


impednance,

i(t) = cdv(t)/dt; V(t) = L..., Q is CV, ,,,


phasor needs to have same function,

so far, we see is AC.

they are all function of frequency

ZeroDivisionError = ...., If

On Jan 8th and 15th, instructor has asked student whether wants to take break
or just class straight. All of class members agree without break only me propose
to have 5 mins break in order for ppl to go to washroom. However, he didn't listen
and proceed every class without even 5 mins break. Even though 5 mins does not
cover too much class material but I definitely deserve I have full access to class
content.

example 7: every node has own voltage,  has three nets or nodes.

phase angle,

电阻 is called resistor

node, if is entering is negative, exist is positve,
